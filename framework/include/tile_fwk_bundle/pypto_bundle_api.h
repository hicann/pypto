 * \brief Two-operation C ABI for a PyPTO kernel bundle (.pyptokb): Workspace + Launch, in a path-based and an
 *        in-memory flavor.
 *
 * Each entry takes a single unified tensor list (all operands including outputs, indexed by flat position). Init /
 * Load / Unload / device-memory are internalized: an idempotent load (cached by hashKey) seeds the AiCpu .so from
 * the bundle, arch-checks, and registers the kernel, all lazily.
