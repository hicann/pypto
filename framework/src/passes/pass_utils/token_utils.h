     * pointers in VarDependency and recreates the producer/consumer entries from
     * the operations currently owned by \p function. A consumer-only entry is

     * \brief Split tokens that have multiple producers into one-producer-per-token.
     *
     * After expansion passes (e.g. ExpandFunction), a single token Var may end up
     * in the \c result_token_ list of multiple operations.  This violates the
     * single-producer expectation and makes downstream token analysis unreliable.
     *
     * This method scans every operation in \p function, groups operations by
     * every token in their \c result_token_ list, and for each token that has
     * more than one producer:
     *   - The first producer keeps the original token Var.
     *   - Every subsequent producer receives a freshly-created token Var that
     *     replaces the original token in its \c result_token_ list.
     *   - All original consumers of the old token have the new token appended
     *     to their \c tokens_ list, preserving the dependency on every producer.
     *
     * Both the Operation-level fields (\c result_token_, \c tokens_) and the
     * Function-level \c VarDependency map are kept consistent.
     *
     * \param function  The function whose operations should be processed.
     * \return SUCCESS on completion, FAILED on internal error.
