 * @brief Common InferShape method, supporting full-graph inference and targeted op inference.
 * 
 * @param function The function on which shape inference is to be performed.
 * @param targetOps List of target operations to infer shapes for. If empty, inference is performed 
 *                  on all operations in the function. If non-empty, only the specified operations 
 *                  are inferred, but it is required that targetOps includes all necessary 
 *                  dependent operations; otherwise, topological ordering and inference may be incorrect.
 * @return Status Operation result, SUCCESS indicates success, FAILED indicates failure.
 * 
 * @note When targetOps is non-empty, only the operations in targetOps are included in the operation set, 
 *       and only edges between operations within targetOps are added during dependency graph construction. 
 *       The caller must ensure that targetOps contains all required dependent operations, or that the 
 *       DynValidShape of those operations is already correctly set, to avoid inference errors caused by 
 *       dependency truncation.
