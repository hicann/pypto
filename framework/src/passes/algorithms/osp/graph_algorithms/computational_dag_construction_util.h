 * @brief Constructs a computational DAG from another graph.
 *
 * This function copies the structure and properties of a source graph into a target graph structure.
 * Assumes that the vertices of the source graph are indexed from 0 to N-1. If the target
 * graph is empty, indices are sequentially assigned starting from 0. If the target graph
 * is not empty, new vertices will be added to the target graph and their indices will be
 * sequentially assigned starting from the index N.
 *
 * @tparam GraphFrom The type of the source graph. Must satisfy `is_computational_dag`.
 * @tparam GraphTo The type of the target graph. Must satisfy `is_constructable_cdag_vertex`.
 * @param from The source graph.
 * @param to The target graph.
