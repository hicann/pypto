 * \brief Pack-side entry points for the kernel bundle (.pyptokb).
 *
 * Lives in tile_fwk_runtime, NOT in libtile_fwk_bundle.so: the pack hooks are called from the compile/emulation and
 * launch paths inside the runtime, whereas the load/query/launch side is the standalone ABI library. Keeping the
 * two halves in separate targets is what breaks the otherwise circular dependency between them.
