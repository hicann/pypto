"""
Test LiteNPU kernel entry-name uniqueness for Kirin9030.

The LiteNPU entry symbol (and the ``kernelName`` field of the JSON sidecar that carries it) is built from the
function magic name plus the function content hash. The magic name alone is ``<function name>_<id>``, where the
function is the generated top-level device function -- so its name reflects the lowering structure rather than
anything the kernel author wrote -- and the id comes from a process-global counter that ``Program::Reset()``
rewinds. Kernels of the same structural shape therefore share a magic name whenever they are built in separate
processes, which is the regime that matters: each operator of a multi-operator offline model is exported and
built by its own process, and the resulting artifacts are only combined afterwards. Colliding entry names make
one kernel's binary shadow the other's inside the combined model.

Two consequences drive the shape of this test:

* The builds must happen in separate interpreters. Inside one interpreter the id counter keeps advancing, so
  two same-named kernels already get distinct magic names and the content hash is not what separates them --
  an in-process test would pass whether or not the hash takes part in the entry name.
* A control case is required. The content hash must depend on the kernel body only. If it picked up anything
  process-varying, the uniqueness assertion would go green for the wrong reason while colliding entry names
  stayed possible. Building the identical kernel in two fresh interpreters and demanding an identical entry
  name is what rules that out.

The sidecar is emitted by ``CodeGenLiteNPU::GenConfigJson`` only in a CANN-enabled build with ASCEND_HOME_PATH
set, so this is a box test: it skips when no sidecar is produced.
