"""Tests for dynValidShape clone in SubstituteStmt (IR snapshot golden).

When a VIEW with a dynamic toValidShape (containing a yield-var SymbolicScalar) is
sunk into both if/else branches by merge_stmts, the output LogicalTensor must be
cloned per-branch so that each branch keeps its own dynValidShape. The snapshot
captures the merged if-tree in golden .pypto files; regenerate them after an
intentional change by printing str(func) (the tests print the merged IR with -s).
