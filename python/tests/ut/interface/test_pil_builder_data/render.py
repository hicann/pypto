"""Render pil-transformed test sources.

Reads every ``test_*.raw.py`` in this directory, transforms it through the pil
frontend (``ast.parse`` -> ``pil_parser.parse_stmts`` -> ``ast.unparse``) and writes the
result to the matching ``test_*.pil.py``. The pil form is semantically
equivalent to the raw form (it is a 3-address normalisation), so both should
behave identically when executed.
