"""End-to-end guard for the kernel bundle (.pyptokb): compile+pack -> segment layout -> load -> launch.

Each test walks the whole route on its own, so a single failing case still pins down which half broke:

  1. PACK    subprocess: compile and run the op with PYPTO_ENABLE_KERNEL_BUNDLE=1, producing a .pyptokb.
  2. INSPECT in-process: parse the container header and the TLV table, and assert the segment layout that
             the scenario implies (notably CtrlFlowCache empty vs. non-empty).
  3. CONSUME subprocess: dlopen libtile_fwk_bundle.so and drive PyptoWorkspace / PyptoLaunch against the file
             alone -- a stand-in for a downstream that has no compiler front end -- then check the numerics.

The two phases have to be separate processes: the consume half must not inherit any recorded Program state
from the pack half, otherwise the test would pass even if the bundle carried nothing.

Scenario coverage:

  ============== ================= ==================== =================================================
  test           control flow      workspace            what it pins down
  ============== ================= ==================== =================================================
  static_add     not value-dep     static, 0 B          baseline round trip; both the path and the
                                                        in-memory ABI variants; CtrlFlowCache non-empty
  dyn_cellmatch  not value-dep     dynamic (symbolic)   SymbolMeta symbol trees + dynamic cell-match
                                                        metas: workspace re-evaluated per launch shape
  value_depend   value-dependent   dynamic              CtrlFlowCache segment EMPTY; the same bundle
                                                        launched twice with different tensor VALUES
  standalone     not value-dep     static, 0 B          the self-contained delivery form: one .so + one
                                                        .pyptokb + configs/, no pypto in the process.
                                                        SKIPPED unless the artifact was built
  ============== ================= ==================== =================================================

Note on dyn_cellmatch: the v1 CtrlFlowCache is a single static-shape snapshot, so a non-value-dependent
bundle may only be LAUNCHED at the shape it was packed with -- launching another shape silently produces
wrong results or trips an AICPU fault. The multi-shape assertion therefore covers PyptoWorkspace only
(pure host, no dispatch), and the launch stays on the packed shape. Lift this once the cache goes dynamic.
