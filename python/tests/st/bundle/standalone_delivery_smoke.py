"""Delivery smoke test for the SELF-CONTAINED kernel-bundle library (libtile_fwk_bundle_standalone.so).

Stands in for a downstream that only consumes .pyptokb files: it loads ONE .so by absolute path, next to ONE
.pyptokb, and proves nothing else from the pypto install tree is needed.

    python3 standalone_delivery_smoke.py <standalone.so> <bundle.pyptokb>

Driven by ``test_kernel_bundle.py::test_bundle_standalone_delivery``, which assembles the delivery directory
first; runnable by hand too (see bundle/E2E_MANUAL.md section 5).

TWO RULES THIS FILE MUST KEEP -- both are constraints, not style:

1. **Never import pypto, and never reuse st/bundle/bundle_abi.py.** The standalone library statically absorbs
   the whole pypto closure, so loading it into a process that also holds the regular pypto stack gives every
   Meyers singleton on that closure (Platform::Instance, DeviceRunner::Get, ConfigManager::Instance,
   OpInfoManager, plus the bundle's own registry and dev-cache) two independent copies -- silent state
   divergence, not a crash. See bundle/CMakeLists.txt and BUNDLE_FLOW.md section 7.2. That is why the
   PyptoTensorDesc / ABI boilerplate below is duplicated from bundle_abi.py rather than imported: bundle_abi
   resolves the DataType enum through ``import pypto``. Do not DRY these two together.

2. **The .so needs a configs/ directory beside it.** GetPyptoLibPath() (utils/file_utils.cpp) uses dladdr to
   find the directory of its OWN .so, and ConfigManager plus the platform ini parsing read configs/ relative
   to it. Missing it reports ErrCode F29002 / FeError::INVALID_FILE. This is a data-file dependency; static
   linking cannot absorb it.
