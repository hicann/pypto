"""
PyPTO Runtime module - High-level kernel programming API.

This module provides:
- @kernel decorator: combines @pl.program + @pl.function for single-kernel use cases
- Extended Tile/Tensor types with manual MemRef specification for address control
- Re-exports of common pypto_pro.language symbols for convenience

Typical usage:
    import pypto_pro.language as pl

    @pl.jit
    def my_kernel(x: pl.Tensor[[64, 128], pl.DT_FP16]) -> pl.Tensor[[64, 128], pl.DT_FP32]:
        tile = pl.load(x, [0, 0], [64, 64])
        result = pl.add(tile, tile)
        return pl.store(result, [0, 0], [64, 64], x)

    # my_kernel is an ir.Program with a single function
