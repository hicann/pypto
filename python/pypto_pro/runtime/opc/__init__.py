"""PyPTO binary-delivery compile leaf for the CANN asc_opc flow.

The whole asc_opc driver (op-store, ``SingleOpCompile`` with ``build_config`` + ``op_context``,
``SingleOpPostCompile``) is reused verbatim from the CANN ``asc_opc_tool`` / ``asc_op_compile_base``
packages — nothing is migrated here. The only PyPTO-specific piece is :func:`pypto_compile_op`, a drop-in
replacement for ``asc_op_compiler.compile_op``'s leaf: it takes a PyPTO DSL ``.py`` and does per-tilingkey
codegen + bisheng compile (reusing the asc_op_compile_base backend), producing the same flat ``kernel_meta``
artifacts. The generated per-op wrapper (ops-transformer ``ascendc_impl_build.py``) calls it in place of
``compile_op``.
