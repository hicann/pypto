    Each field's fill comes from info.ctx_sources, recorded when the field was created. The
    task counter is the exception, being the transform's own (see _astutil.task_id_var).

    A source living inside a ``pl.section_*()`` block gets its fill wrapped in that same
    section, since the other target's parse never binds that name. A source bound in BOTH
    sections gets a fill in each — the two targets compile to separate functions with
    separate ctx arrays.
