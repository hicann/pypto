    branch, inside a helper function, or across several statements all behave the same.

    A field coming from a struct reads `<struct>.<field>`; a scalar reads its variable
    (under the variable's own name, which may differ from the field name after a collision
    rename); a framework field such as _pl_task_id reads its same-named variable.

    A field whose source lives inside a ``pl.section_*()`` block gets its fill wrapped in
    that same section. Both targets write the same ctx memory, but only one of them can see
    such a name — the other's parse skips the block entirely — so an unwrapped fill would be
    emitted for both, and the target that cannot see the source would fill the field from a
    stale initial value and overwrite the real one.
