"""Cross-core sync dependency graph: the single source for all sync insertion.

One model covers sync_only, preload=N and address reuse. Replaces the old
per-case derivation, which worked per address-overlapping buffer PAIR and so emitted one
reverse-sync edge where a region with k writers needs k.

Model
-----
node    an op-level access ``Access(stage, buffer, role, pipe)``
region  a physical memory area — union-find over ``addr_overlaps``, so co-located buffers
        land in one region and a non-reused buffer is a region of its own
lane    one (region, physical slot): everything competing for that exact memory, in time
        order. Edges only ever form inside a lane, which is why address reuse needs no
        special case.
edge    RAW  a read waits for the nearest preceding write of the same buffer
        WAR  a write waits for the readers of the nearest preceding write per buffer on
             that slot — same buffer gives the ordinary backward edge, a co-located
             neighbour gives the reuse edge

Distances come from expanding the slot timeline, not from arithmetic on slot counts, and
both quantities matter: ``dist`` (beat difference) decides inverse-time and cycles, while
``task_off`` (task difference) is the guard constant and the event-id pairing.

Assumptions
-----------
A1. Each stage advances a cross-core buffer exactly once, so ``slot = task % slot_count``.
    The whole timeline rests on this. Not validated: supporting more slots per iteration is
    a likely extension, so a violation is left to show up as a wrong distance rather than
    being rejected up front.
A2. A buffer variable carries one producer/consumer pair; a stage may touch it repeatedly.
A3. Sync goes outside the stage call. Op-level detail gets the dependencies right, then
    the result is aggregated back to the stage boundary when emitting.

Control flow inside a stage is ignored on purpose: an access in a branch counts like an
unconditional one, so a buffer touched on several pipes gets a sync on every one of them.
That over-syncs when a path skips some, and the cost is real (a wait blocks its pipe even
on iterations that never touch the buffer), but the error only ever goes in the safe
direction. Narrowing it down would take reasoning about the branch conditions, and a wrong
answer there drops a sync instead — see stage_control_flow_design.md.
