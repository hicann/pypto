    Args:
        preload: Number of times the first stage pre-fires before steady-state
                 alternation begins. E.g. preload=2 means C1 C1 C1 C2 C1 C2 ...
                 The actual ctx ring-buffer depth is computed from the stage
                 delays (max_delay + 1), not from preload directly.
        sync_only: If True, do NOT transform into a preload pipeline; only
                 auto-insert cross-core sync around each stage in the original
                 serial loop. Lets users validate their serial kernel is correct
                 before enabling the full pipeline. Default False (full pipeline).

    The transformed source is always written to the build directory as
    ``pipeline_generated.py`` for inspection.
