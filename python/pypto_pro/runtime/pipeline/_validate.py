"""Checks on a kernel's pipeline structure, gathered in one place.

Checks used to sit wherever the data happened to be parsed — some inside scanning loops,
some mid-way through analyze_pipeline, some in the transformer. Adding one meant finding
the right scanning function and editing it. They are collected here instead, grouped by
what they need to already know:

``validate_structure(info)``  after the stage sequence, sections, loop info and ctx
                              fields are known, before any sync scanning
``validate_sync(...)``        after the sync graph exists (see _sync_graph)
``validate_names(...)``       once the caller knows which variables it will introduce —
                              both emission paths, each passing its own names
``validate_schedule(info)``   after delays are computed (full pipeline only; sync_only
                              never computes delays, so it has no schedule to check)

Format checks stay at their point of use: if a buffer's memory space or its id tuple
cannot be resolved, scanning cannot continue, so those raise where they are read.
