"""Cross-core access scanner for preload pipeline auto-sync.

Pure-AST analysis. Scans the kernel body for cross-core NBuffer declarations
(those configured with cross_core_forward_id / cross_core_backward_id), then
scans each @stage function body to determine, for each cross-core buffer it
touches, the access role (W/R) and the pipe of the op that does the access.

The result drives automatic wait/set_cross_core insertion at stage boundaries.
