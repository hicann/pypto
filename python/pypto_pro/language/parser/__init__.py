Language Parser module for converting high-level DSL code to IR structures.

This module (pypto_pro.language.parser) provides a decorator-based system for
parsing Python functions with DSL annotations and converting them to IR

Part of the pypto_pro.language package - use via:
    import pypto_pro.language as pl

    @pl.function
    def my_func(...):
        ...
