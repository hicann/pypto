"""The two gates a gated call passes before its builder sees it.

Both read the same source of truth, the ``@_api_decl`` declarations, and differ in
when they run. ``check_declared_params`` runs before any argument is evaluated and
settles which parameters the call names and how many it passes, which is all its
written form can answer. ``check_declared_types`` runs after, on the parsed values,
and settles what each one turned out to be.
Whether a value is *legal* -- a dtype off the whitelist, two shapes that disagree --
is neither gate's business and stays in the builders.

A role is read from an annotation as it is *written*, never as typing resolves it:
the user-facing aliases in ``language/_api.py`` are all ``Any``, so the resolved form
says nothing. Anything a role does not describe is left alone -- an unannotated
parameter, ``Any``, a union with one unfamiliar branch -- because a role nobody wrote
down is not grounds to reject an argument the builder may well accept.
