- **hc_mult** (`int`): Optional parameter. Expansion rate in mHC. Data type supports `int`. Default is `4`.
- **hc_split_sinkhorn_iters** (`int`): Optional parameter. Number of sinkhorn iterations. Data type supports `int`. Default is `20`.
- **hc_eps** (`float`): Optional parameter. Addition value for numerical stability in RMSNorm denominator computation and Sinkhorn-Knopp computation. Data type supports `float`. Default is `1e-6`.

## Return Value Description

- **y** (`Tensor`): Output in the formula. Data format is ND. Data type is `bfloat16`. When layout\_x is TND, shape is [t, h].
- **post** (`Tensor`): Output post from sinkhorn in the formula. Data format is ND. Data type is `float`. When layout\_x is TND, shape is [t, hc_mult].
- **comb** (`Tensor`): Output comb from sinkhorn in the formula. Data format is ND. Data type is `float`. When layout\_x is TND, shape is [t, hc_mult, hc_mult].

## Constraint Description

- This interface supports inference scenarios only.
- In input parameter x, shape [t, hc_mult, h] supports h as `4096` only.
- The shape, dtype, and so on of the input parameters must be consistent with the parameter description.
- The range of t is [1, 64k].
