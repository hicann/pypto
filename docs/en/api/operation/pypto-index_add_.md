## Description

Multiplies each data block of **source** by the scaling factor **alpha** (defaulting to 1) and adds it to the corresponding data block of **input**, where the index and data block direction are specified by **index** and **dim**. For example,
$$ input[index[i], :, :] += alpha * source[i, :, :],\ if \ dim == 0, \\
    input[:, index[i], :] += alpha * source[:, i, :],\ if \ dim == 1,\\
    input[:, :, index[i]] += alpha * source[:, :, i],\ if \ dim == 2.$$

## Prototype

```python
index_add_(input: Tensor, dim: int, index: Tensor, source: Tensor, *, alpha: Union[int, float] = 1) -> Tensor
```

## Return Value

The in-place operation returns **input**.

## Constraints

1. `index` must be of integer type (DT_INT32 or DT_INT64), with values not exceeding the shape size of `input` along the `dim` axis. It must be 1-dimensional, and its shape size must match that of the `dim` axis of `source`.

2. **dim** is of the **int** type, with a value range of $-input.dim\leq dim < input.dim$.

3. **input** and **source** have the same data type and dimensionality.

4. The ViewShape of the non-**dim** axes of **input.shape** and **source.shape** cannot be tiled, that is, $ViewShape[i] \geq input.shape[i]=source.shape[i], i \ne dim$.

5. The dimensionality of the TileShape is the same as that of **source**, and it is used only to tile **source** and **index**. The total size of the TileShapes of all inputs and outputs must not exceed the size of the UB memory.
6. Tensor inputs do not support the `TileOpFormat.TILEOP_NZ` format.

## Examples

### TileShape Setting Example

Before calling this operation API, set the TileShape through **set_vec_tile_shapes**.

For an input `[m, n, p]` with `dim=1`, a source of `[m, t, p]`, and an index of `[t]`, the output is `[m, n, p]`. If the `TileShape` is set to `[m1, t1, p1]`, then `m1`, `t1`, and `p1` are used to tile the `m`, `t`, and `p` axes of the source, respectively.

```python
pypto.set_vec_tile_shapes(4, 16, 32)
```

### API Call Example

```python
x = pypto.tensor([2, 3], pypto.DT_INT32)        # shape (2, 3)
source = pypto.tensor([3, 3], pypto.DT_INT32)   # shape (3, 3)
index = pypto.tensor([3], pypto.DT_INT32)   # shape (3,)
dim = 0
# use alpha
y = pypto.index_add_(x, dim, index, source, alpha=1)
# not use alpha
y = pypto.index_add_(x, dim, index, source)
```

The results are as follows:

```python
Input data x:   [[0 0 0],
               [0 0 0]]
      source: [[1 1 1],
               [1 1 1],
               [1 1 1]]
      index:   [0 1 0]
Output data y:   [[2 2 2],
               [1 1 1]]               # shape (2, 3)
```
