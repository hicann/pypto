## Description

**condition** is a Boolean mask tensor. For an element at any position in the tensor, this operation performs element-wise selection based on the Boolean mask tensor **condition**. Its computation behavior can be formally expressed as follows.

$$
result_{i}=
\begin{cases}
input_{i} & \text{if } condition_{i}==True \\
other_{i} & \text{if } condition_{i}==False
\end{cases}
$$

**condition** must be a **Tensor**. **input** and **other** can be a **Tensor**, **float**, or **Element**. The broadcast rules are as follows (only single-axis broadcast is supported):

1. When **input**, **other**, and **condition** are all **Tensor**s, the **Shape** of **result** is obtained by broadcasting the three.

    Example: **input**: \[1,20,20\], **other**: \[20,1,20\], **condition**: \[20,20,1\], **result**: \[20,20,20\]

2. When only **input** and **condition** are **Tensor**s, the **Shape** of **result** is obtained by broadcasting the two.

    Example: **input**: \[1,20,20\], **condition**: \[20,20,1\], **result**: \[20,20,20\]

3. When only other and condition are Tensors, the shape of result is obtained by broadcasting the two.

    Example: other: \[20,1,20\], condition: \[20,20,1\], result: \[20,20,20\]

4. When only condition is a Tensor, the shape of result is consistent with condition.

## Prototype

```python
where(
    condition: Tensor,
    input: Union[Tensor, float, Element],
    other: Union[Tensor, float, Element]
) -> Tensor
```

| Parameter   | Input/Output | Description                                                                 |

## Return Value

**result**: Tensor. The shape is obtained by broadcasting the inputs. For detailed broadcasting scenarios, see the preceding description. The data type is consistent with **input** and **other**.

## Constraints

1. When input or other is a float scalar, float is automatically converted to an Element of DT_FP32. If the other parameter is a Tensor whose data type is not DT_FP32 (such as DT_FP16 or DT_BF16), a type mismatch interception error is triggered, and this usage is not supported. Use Element to construct a data type consistent with the Tensor, for example: `pypto.Element(pypto.DT_FP16, 1.0)`.
2. The dimensions of condition, input (if it is a Tensor), and other (if it is a Tensor) must be the same. For example, condition: [64], input: [2, 64], other: [2, 64] is invalid; it should be set to condition: [1, 64], input: [2, 64], other: [2, 64].
3. Data type description for Tensor and Element of input and other:
   - Ascend 950PR/Ascend 950DT: DT_INT32, DT_FP32, DT_INT16, DT_FP16, DT_BF16, DT_UINT8, DT_INT8.
   - Atlas A3 training products/Atlas A3 inference products: DT_INT32, DT_INT16, DT_FP16, DT_FP32, and DT_BF16.
   - Atlas A2 training products/Atlas A2 inference products: DT_INT32, DT_INT16, DT_FP16, DT_FP32, and DT_BF16.
4. Tensor inputs do not support the `TileOpFormat.TILEOP_NZ` format.

## Example

### TileShape Setting Example

Note: Before calling this operation API, set the TileShape through **set_vec_tile_shapes**.

The dimensions of the TileShape must be the same as those of the output.

Example 1: In a non-broadcasting scenario, where the input condition is [m, n], input is [m, n], other is [m, n], and the output is [m, n], with TileShape set to [m1, n1], m1 and n1 are used to tile the m and n axes, respectively.

```python
pypto.set_vec_tile_shapes(4, 16)
```

Example 2: Broadcast scenario, where **condition** is [m, 1], **input** is [m, n], **other** is [m, n], and the output is [m, n]. When **TileShape** is set to [m1, n1], m1 and n1 are used to tile the m and n axes, respectively.

```python
pypto.set_vec_tile_shapes(4, 16)
```

### API Call Example

```python
cond1 = pypto.tensor([4], pypto.DT_BOOL)
a1 = pypto.tensor([4], pypto.DT_FP32)
b1 = pypto.tensor([4], pypto.DT_FP32)
out1 = pypto.where(cond1, a1, b1)

# Using scalar inputs
out2 = pypto.where(cond1, 1, 0)

# Broadcasting example
cond2 = pypto.tensor([2, 2], pypto.DT_BOOL)
a2 = pypto.tensor([2], pypto.DT_FP32)
b2 = 0.0
out3 = pypto.where(cond2, a2, b2)
```

The results are as follows:

```python
Input data cond1: [True, False, True, False]
Input data a1:    [1.0  2.0  3.0  4.0]
Input data b1:    [10.0 20.0 30.0 40.0]
Output data out1:  [1.0  20.0 3.0  40.0]

Output data out2:  [1.0 0.0 1.0 0.0]

Input data cond2 = [[True, False], [False, True]]
Input data a2:      [1.0 2.0]
Output data out3:   [[1.0 0.0],
                 [0.0 2.0]]
```
