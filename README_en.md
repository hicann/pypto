## Overview

PyPTO (pronounced: pai p-t-o) is a high-performance programming framework for AI accelerators. It aims to simplify the development process of complex fused operators and even entire model networks while maintaining high-performance computing capability. The framework adopts an innovative **PTO (Parallel Tensor/Tile Operation) programming paradigm** with a **Tile-based programming model** as its core design concept. Through a multi-level intermediate representation (IR) system, it gradually compiles AI model applications built through APIs from high-level tensor graphs into hardware instructions, finally generating executable code that runs efficiently on the target platform.

### Core Features

- **Tile-based Programming Model**: All computations operate on Tiles (hardware-aware data blocks), fully leveraging hardware parallel computing capabilities and memory hierarchy.
- **Multi-level Computation Graph Transformation**: The compilation Pass transforms a Tensor Graph into a Tile Graph, Block Graph, and Execution Graph. Each step includes a series of Pass optimization processes.
- **Automated Code Generation**: The compilation result generates low-level PTO virtual instruction code through CodeGen, and then the compiler compiles the virtual instruction code into executable code for the target platform.
- **MPMD Execution Scheduling**: Executable code loads onto the device side and schedules to the processor cores on the device through MPMD (Multiple Program Multiple Data).
- **Complete Toolchain Support**: The IDE-integrated toolchain visualizes the full-process compilation intermediates and runtime performance data to identify performance bottlenecks. Developers can also control compilation and scheduling behavior through the toolchain.
- **Python-friendly API**: Provides intuitive Tensor-level abstractions that align with algorithm developers' thinking patterns, supporting dynamic shapes and symbolic programming.
- **Layered Abstraction Design**: Exposes different abstraction levels to different developers. Algorithm developers use the Tensor level, performance experts use the Tile level, and system developers use the Block level.

### Target Users

- **Algorithm Developers**: Primarily use the Tensor level for programming, quickly implementing and verifying algorithms while focusing on algorithm logic.
- **Performance Optimization Experts**: Use the Tile or Block level for deep performance tuning to achieve极致 performance.
- **System Developers**: Work at the Tensor/Tile/Block and PTO virtual instruction set levels for third-party framework integration or toolchain development.
